# ### My Each
# Extend the Array class to include a method named `my_each` that takes a
# block, calls the block on every element of the array, and then returns
# the original array. Do not use Enumerable's `each` method. I want to be
# able to write:
#
# ```ruby
# # calls my_each twice on the array, printing all the numbers twice.
# return_value = [1, 2, 3].my_each do |num|
#   puts num
# end.my_each do |num|
#   puts num
# end
# # => 1
#      2
#      3
#      1
#      2
#      3
#
# p return_value # => [1, 2, 3]
# ```

class Array
  def my_each(&prc)
  
  end
end

# ### My Enumerable Methods
# * Implement new `Array` methods `my_map` and `my_select`. Do
#   it by monkey-patching the `Array` class. Don't use any of the
#   original versions when writing these. Use your `my_each` method to
#   define the others. Remember that `each`/`map`/`select` do not modify
#   the original array.
# * Implement a `my_inject` method. Your version shouldn't take an
#   optional starting argument; just use the first element. Ruby's
#   `inject` is fancy (you can write `[1, 2, 3].inject(:+)` to shorten
#   up `[1, 2, 3].inject { |sum, num| sum + num }`), but do the block
#   (and not the symbol) version. Again, use your `my_each` to define
#   `my_inject`. Again, do not modify the original array.

class Array
  def my_map(&prc)

  end

  def my_select(&prc)

  end


end

# ### Concatenate
# Create a method that takes in an `Array` of `String`s and uses `inject`
# to return the concatenation of the strings.
#
# ```ruby
# concatenate(["Yay ", "for ", "strings!"])
# # => "Yay for strings!"
# ```
