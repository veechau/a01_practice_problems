# A number's aliquot sum is the sum of all of its factors excluding itself.
#
# For example, the aliquot sum of 10 is: 1 + 2 + 5 = 8
#
# We can use the aliquot sum to define a special sequence, called the
# aliquot sequence. The aliquot sequence of a number begins with the
# number itself. The second number in the sequence is the first number's
# aliquot sum, the third number is the second number's aliquot sum, and
# so on.
#
# For example, the first 4 numbers in the aliquot sequence of 10 are: 10, 8, 7, 1
#
# Write a function that takes in two numbers, base and n, and returns the
# aliquot sequence of length n starting with base.
#
